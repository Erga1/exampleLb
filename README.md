##About
This system is designed to manage books and borrowers in a library. It has three main tabs: Available Books,  Account, and about.
The Available Books tab displays a list of available books, and the Account tab displays account information, and about tab displays about the system and the developer.
The system also has a Return Book feature that allows users to return borrowed books.

## Getting Started

Welcome to the VS Code Java world. Here is a guideline to help you get started to write Java code in Visual Studio Code.

## Folder Structure

The workspace contains two folders by default, where:

- `src`: the folder to maintain sources
- `lib`: the folder to maintain dependencies

Meanwhile, the compiled output files will be generated in the `bin` folder by default.

> If you want to customize the folder structure, open `.vscode/settings.json` and update the related settings there.

## Dependency Management

The `JAVA PROJECTS` view allows you to manage your dependencies. More details can be found [here](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-java-dependency#manage-dependencies).
